[CheerLights](https://cheerlights.com/) is an “Internet of Things” project that I created back in 2011 to help teach people IoT concepts. I consider it a “Hello, World” project to learn IoT protocols, microcontroller programming, and LED light control. CheerLights is a global network of synchronized colored lights. Everyone subscribes to the latest CheerLights color and sets their lights to the same color. The color is either set on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cheerlights/status/1575133134340997122) or on the [CheerLights Discord Server](https://cheerlights.com/discord) by anyone.
